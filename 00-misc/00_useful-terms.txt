A unary function is one that accepts one argument.
A unary predicate is a unary function that returns a bool.

Predicates are hence functions that help make a decision by returning true or false.

So in short, initialize is the term commonly used with variables whenever u assign a value to it before executing, where as instantiation refers to assigning an Object to a class(which in turn act as the reference to variables and methods/functions of that class).
