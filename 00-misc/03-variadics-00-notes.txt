1. ellipsis

  i. Ellipses began as a c++ operator that allow the passing of a variable number of arguments to a function. 

    The function declaration would look something like this:
    MyFunction(int i, ...);

  ii. c++11 introduced parameter packs and variadic templates to improve on ellipsis-like functionality. However, usability prevented their widespread adoption (they are a pain in the ass to use)
    - see 03-variadics-02-templates.cpp for examples.

  iii. c++17 introduced fold expressions.
    - supposedly these are easier to use - something to research another day

  iv. Ellipses are also used in other contexts.
    - sizeof... vs sizeof
    - try-catch blocks

2. <cstdarg>

  #include <cstdarg>
    This header defines macros to access the individual arguments of a list of unnamed arguments whose number and types are not known to the called function.
