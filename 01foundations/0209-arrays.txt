Arrays are a lower level data structure than vectors (and can be slightly more efficient in terms of memory and element access). 

Arrays have a fixed length.

Arrays may require careful memory mangement, depending on how they are used. 

Arrays represent a fixed size chunk of memory.

Bjarne says: 
- whenever you declare an array, it usually turns into a pointer and forgets the amount of memory that's allocated

- you should wrap an array inside of a vector to manage its memory
  - how to do this?
