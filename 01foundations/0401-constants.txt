c++ supports two notions of immutability, designated by the following keywords:
  i. const 
    - a const variable can be evaluated at run time
    - "I promise not to change this value after it is initialized"
  ii. constexpr 
    - a constexpr variable can be evaluated at compile time, but NOT at run time
    - constexpr is primarily used to specify constants
