3. What is relationship between constructors and instantiation?

====================================================

1. What is a constructor?

  i. A constructor is a function which constructs objects of a class.

  ii. All classes come with a default constructor which doesn't accept any arguments. The compiler defines it.

  iii. We can also define our own constructors so that there can be multiple ways to instantiate an object of a class.

  iv. It's a general rule not to have any complex logic in a constructor because it's hard to handle errors that take place in a constructor.

  v. constructors typically establish invariants (but through helper functions?)

====================================================

2. What is instantiation?

  a. Instantiation is the creation of a new instance of a class.

  b. When a class is instantiated, memory is allocated for the object and the class's construction is called.

  c. there are two ways to instantiate a class:
    i. on the stack as a variable declaration
    ii. on the heap with the new keyword

====================================================

3. What is relationship between constructors and instantiation?

  Constructors tell the compiler how to instantiate the instance.
