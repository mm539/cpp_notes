Initializer Lists
***************************

  Initializer lists allow us to initialize the values of member variables even before the object is created.

  Typically, we can use an initializer list for values that do not have a setter function (and an invariant).

  Initializer lists exist for at least 3 reasons.
    1. optimization
      compiler can optimize initialization faster from an initialization list than from within the constructor.

    2. const
      if you have a const class attribute, you can only initialize it using an initialization list. (otherwise, the const keyword would be violated by initializing the variable within the constructor)

    3. references
      attributes defined as references MUST use initialization lists
