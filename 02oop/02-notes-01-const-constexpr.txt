C++ supports two notions of immutability

1. const - only evaluated at run time

compiler checks if value is not changed

2. constexpr - can be evaluated at compile time

***************


A common usage of const is to guard against accidentally changing a variable

The distinction between const and constexpr is subtle.

In general, though, const is much more common than constexpr.

When in doubt, use const, especially to guard against accidentally modifying a variable.
