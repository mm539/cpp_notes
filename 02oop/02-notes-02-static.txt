1. the keyword static

  The keyword static has different meanings depending on where it's used:
    i. declarations of namespace members with static storage duration and internal linkage
    ii. definitions of block scope variables with static storage duration and initialized once
    iii. declarations of class members not bound to specific instances

  As this section of notes is dedicated to OOP, we'll be looking at use #3.

2. Static Member Variables and Methods

  i. A static member belongs to the entire class, instead of to a specific instance of the class.

  ii.. A static member is created only once and then shared by all instances of the class.
    --> so if a static member gets changed, then all members of the class will see that change

  iii. static members can be defined/instantiated
    i. within their class IF the keyword constexpr is also used (remember: constexpr tells the compiler to evalute a value at compile time)

    ii. in the global scope.


  iv. We can use static methods to use functions without ever creating an instance of a class.
    - Static methods can be used to group together related operations.
