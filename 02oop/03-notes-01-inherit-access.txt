=======================================================================

1. Access Specifiers

Access specifiers define which class members users can access.
Access specifiers also define which class members users of a DERIVED CLASS can access.

public - members are accessible from outside the class
private - members are not accessible from outside the class
protected - members cannot be accessed from outside the class; however, they can be access within inherited classes

=======================================================================

2. Inheritance and access specifiers/modifers

There is an interplay between the access status of members of a class and the type of inheritance specified by a derived class.

1. Public inheritance:
public -> public
protected -> protected
private -> unaccessible (unless friended)

2. Protected inheritance:
public -> protected
protected -> protected
private -> unaccessible (unless friended)

3. Private inheritance:
public -> private
protected -> private
private -> unaccessible (unless friended)
