Multiple inheritance is when a class inherits from multiple classes.

===============================================================

1. When should you use mutliple inheritance?

The Core Guidelines have some worthwhile recommendations about how and when to use multiple inheritance:

    "Use multiple inheritance to represent multiple distinct interfaces"
    "Use multiple inheritance to represent the union of implementation attributes"

===============================================================

2. The diamond problem

If a class inhertis from two base classes, both of which themselves inherit from the same abstract class, a conflict can emerge.
