  UDACITY NOTES - With malloc, the program crashes on calling the method setNumber, as no memory has been allocated for _number - because the constructor has not been called. Hence, an EXC_BAD_ACCESS error occurs, when trying to access the memory location to which _number is pointing. 
  HOWEVER

  Although it's true that the constructor and destructor weren't called, my program didn't crash.

  In main, we are now creating an array of three objects of MyClass. Also, the overloaded new and delete operators have been changed to accept arrays. Let us take a look at the console output:

new: Allocating 20 bytes of memory
Constructor is called
Constructor is called
Constructor is called
Destructor is called
Destructor is called
Destructor is called
delete: Memory is freed again 

Interestingly, the memory requirement is larger than expected: With new, the block size was 4 bytes, which is exactly the space required for a single integer. Thus, with three integers, it should now be 12 bytes instead of 20 bytes. The reason for this is the memory allocation overhead that the compiler needs to keep track of the allocated blocks of memory - which in itself consumes memory. If we change the above call to e.g. new MyClass[100](), we will see that the overhead of 8 bytes does not change:

new: Allocating 408 bytes of memory
Constructor is called
â€¦
Destructor is called
delete: Memory is freed again
