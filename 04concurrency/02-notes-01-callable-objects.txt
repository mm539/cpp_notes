1. What are callable objects?

  Passing functions to other functions is one form of using "callable objects."

  In c++, a callable object is an object that can appear as the left-hand operand of the call operator. These can be:
    i. pointers to functions
    ii. objects of a class that define an overloaded function call operator
    iii. lambdas (anonymous inline functions)
