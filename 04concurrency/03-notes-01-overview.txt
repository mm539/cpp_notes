DATA CHANNELS

this lesson is about passing data from the child thread to the parent thread after the thread has been created.

1. ways to create such channels:
  i. promises & futures & threads
  ii. std::async
  iii. std::packaged_task (not covered here)

2. differences between threads and tasks
  - tasks are high level, it's easier/less writing to pass data through them
  - tasks are created by async

3. passing data to thread by value (copies, move semantics)
